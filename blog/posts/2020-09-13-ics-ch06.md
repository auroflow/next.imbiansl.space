## Problem Solving

The three constructs:

1\. Sequential

```
TASK_1
TASK_2
```

2\. Conditional

```
Generate condition
0000 ??? _________ (use BR to jump to SUBTASK_1)
SUBTASK_2
0000 111 _________ (use BR to jump to NEXT_TASK)
SUBTASK_1
NEXT_TASK
```

3\. Iterative

```
Generate condition
0000 ??? _________ (use BR to jump to NEXT_TASK)
SUBTASK
0000 111 _________ (use BR to jump back to the previous BR instruction)
NEXT_TASK
```

## Debugging

It is useful to examine results at the end of the execution of each **module** if something goes wrong.
