## Bit & Bytes

**Bit**: Binary digits, two states (0 / 1)
**Byte**: 8 bits

## Data Types

### Unary

n 1's for number n. e.g. 11111 represents 5.

### ASCII Codes

The way to transfer information between the computer and the keyboard.

```
48 0x30 --- '1'
65 0x41 --- 'A'
97 0x61 --- 'a'
```
### Unsigned Integers

### 2's Complement Integers

```
000 --- 0
001 --- 1
010 --- 2
011 --- 3
========== (An OVERFLOW if crossing this boundary)
100 --- -4
101 --- -3
110 --- -2
111 --- -1
(Note that the sum of the binary codes of two
complementary integers is 000)
```

_How to quickly obtain -A: add 1 to the complement of A. i.e. -A = ~A + 1_

**S**ign-**EXT**ention: To extend the length of a representation, just extend the sign bit to the left.

**Examining overflows**: There is an overflow if and only if two positive numbers produce a negative sum, or two negative numbers produce a positive sum.

### Bit Vectors

A collection of N bits that escribes states of N items. In LC-3, N = 16.

We can use logical operations & bit masks to modify a certain bit in the bit vector.

#### Logical Operations

Deal with logical variables (Booleans) and bit vectors.

NOT/COMPLEMENT/INVERT: NOT(0) = 1, NOT(1) = 0.

| X | Y | ALL(X,Y) / X AND Y / XY | ANY(X,Y) / X OR Y / X+Y | X XOR Y |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

In LC-3, NOT and AND are in the ISA. OR can be operated with De Morgan's Law:

OR(X,Y) = NOT(AND(NOT(X),NOT(Y)))

#### Bit masks

Can let us deal only with the bits we care about. For example, to clear the rightmost bit of a 6-bit vector and maintain the values of the other bits, AND it with the bit mask `111110`. To set the rightmost bit of a 6-bit vector to 1, OR it with the bit mask `000001`.

### Floating point

(will not be used in LC-3)

Takes up 32(64/16) bits.

| 1 | ← e = 8(11/5) → | ← 23(52/10) → |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| sign | exponent<br />represents the range | fraction<br /> represents the position |

N = (-1)<sup>sign</sup> * 1.fraction * 2<sup>exponent-(2<sup>e-1</sup>+1)</sup>

2<sup>e-1</sup>+1 is called the excess code (the bias).

The fraction part won't save the most significant bit, because it's 1 for sure.

For example, to express 6.625, first convert it to normalised binary form:

6.625 = 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>-1</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>-3</sup> = 110.101 = 1.10101000... * 2<sup>129-127</sup>

So it can be coded:

```
0 10000001 10101000000000000000000
```

If the length of fraction part is not enough, the least significant bits will be rounded (**rounded**: lost due to limited space [truncated: lost due to limited time]).
